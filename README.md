# Callbacks and Node Review

## Basic server

- [ ] Implement a basic express web server in `basic-server.js` that accepts a GET request to `localhost:3000/users` and sends back a json response with 30 users. 
- [ ] The user information should be retrieved from this url: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` using the `request` module.

## Callback Practice

- [ ] Complete the `getUsernames` function inside of `callback-practice.js`. The `getUsernames` function should take in an array of user Ids, and call the `callback` function with the array of usernames as its argument.
- [ ] The user information should be retrieved from the JSON placeholder API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
